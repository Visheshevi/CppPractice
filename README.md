This repository is used for revising C++ in order to prepare for job interviews.

The solutions that are addressed in this repository are based on the book "Cracking the Coding Interview"


The file threeDimNum.py is based on the follwoing question.
Can the given number be divided into groups of three?

Eg -  given a number 8
we can find a solution 2 x 2 x 2

Or, given a number 14
we cannot find a solution as it can only has a solution 7 x 2.

BinaryTree.cpp contains the program to create a binary tree and traverse the binary tree in preorder, post order and pre order.

separateChainingHashTable.cpp contains the program to implement hash table.

Chapter 4 - Trees and Graphs

4.1) Function implemented to check the balance of the tree in AVLInsertionDeletion.cpp
4.2) Function implemented to find whether a  path exists from given node to another in isThereARoute.cpp
4.3) BTSortedArrayMinimalHeight.cpp creates a tree of minimal height from the given sorted array.
4.6) firstCommonAncestor.cpp finds the common ancestor of the given nodes in a Binary Tree(Not a BST)
4.7) isItASubTree.cpp finds out if a given tree is a subtree of the other or not



Graphs

Prerequisite: Create a graph with adjacency matrix and another with adjacency list. Do a BFS and DFS.
Files - establishAGraphWithAdjacencyList.cpp, establishAGraphWithAdjacencyMatrix.cpp, directedGraphAdjacencyList.cpp
The file directedGraphAdjacencyList.cpp contains the BFS and DFS functions.

Chapter 5 - Bit manipulation
5.1) The file setAtspecifiedbits.cpp contains a code to make a number a substring of the other number.
5.2) Given a string, the file decimal2binary.cpp converts the decimal number into binary.
5.3) Given a number, the file nextLargestSmaller.cpp gives the next highest and smallest number having the same number of 1s. 
Bit manipulation problems added. Just to get accustomed if any interview request arises.
